## Overview

AppointmentLelo.io is a fullstack role-based scheduling platform:

- `USER` can browse services, view available slots, and book appointments.
- `SERVICE_PROVIDER` can create services, set availability, and track daily schedules.

It includes a modern SaaS landing page, dark/light theme support, responsive layouts, and secure backend APIs.
